Firstly, formal votes are usually (although not always for politically sensitive issues) formalities, as consent between the Parliament and Council has already before been reached in the so called trilogue negotiations. Votes are usually only rubberstamping that. Either there is a compromise in which case the vote takes place and usually just is a yes or there is no compromise in which case there usually is no vote. Secondly, this graph conflates voting in the EP and the Council. Blocking minorities or rather double qualified majorities are only a thing in the Council of the EU. The graph for some reasons shows how many MEPs voiced aupport or opposition. Parliament usually votes by simple majority and by party lines not national lines. There is no such thing as \"Germany supporting a proposal in Parliament\". Germany in Council and German MEPs in EP are two completely different entities and votes. Even MEPs from governmental parties might vote entirely different from their government in the council, although rare. In general, both institutions try to be as uniform a front as possible as the divide usually is often more Parliament against Council as opposed to country vs country or party vs party. For this reason, letters to MEPs do not really make sense if the goal is to achieve a blocking minority in the Council. Those letters would have to go to governments.",

The mainstream social media platforms have the tools to easily detect bots without identification or chat control. Do you remember the \"prove you're not a bot\" prompts when opening websites, measures like that could work on social media as well. \n\nThe real reason why social media is full of bots is late stage capitalism. Social media companies are chasing infinite growth in an a relatively finite market. The only way they can really grow/inflate their numbers is with bots. Imagine if we would take out all bot users of social media platforms today, the stock prices of these companies would plummet, because it would become apparent how many real users they actually have, which is far less than the reported figures. In other words, social media companies benefit massively from bots, so why would they solve the issue? Chat control and online ID won't change that.\n\nSecondly, chat control won't protect us from criminals either. Criminals can easily use their own platforms, like they do today, to circumvent this legislation. It's like using a shotgun to kill a fly, but the fly can easily fly in any other direction to evade it. \n\nThe only thing this proposed legislation can achieve is mass surveillance, there are no other \"benefits\". You might think: \"I'm not that interesting, so why do I care?\". The thing is, there are numerous people that are interesting to be surveilled at this level. Think journalists, judges, lawyers, politicians, police, etc. These professions have one thing in common: they are responsible to uphold our democratic norms and values, they ensure that the political powers remain separated and in check. \n\nImagine you're Russia, China, or any criminal organisation capable of hacking secure infrastructure. With this legislation, they have a honeypot to with 1 hack, social engineering or infiltration, get all chat history of people in influential or important positions. They can blackmail and extort these people to get what they want. It is a massive, massive risk to democracy.\n\nSo when you say: \"I'm in favor of a more controlled internet\", you're basically saying: \"I wave all my democratic rights and be a loyal servant to whatever regime holds the keys to the internet.\" Today, this regime can be a regime you trust, but you just created the tools for whichever regime comes after to have total control over the internet.",

Firstly, formal votes are usually (although not always for politically sensitive issues) formalities, as consent between the Parliament and Council has already before been reached in the so called trilogue negotiations. Votes are usually only rubberstamping that. Either there is a compromise in which case the vote takes place and usually just is a yes or there is no compromise in which case there usually is no vote. Secondly, this graph conflates voting in the EP and the Council. Blocking minorities or rather double qualified majorities are only a thing in the Council of the EU. The graph for some reasons shows how many MEPs voiced aupport or opposition. Parliament usually votes by simple majority and by party lines not national lines. There is no such thing as \"Germany supporting a proposal in Parliament\". Germany in Council and German MEPs in EP are two completely different entities and votes. Even MEPs from governmental parties might vote entirely different from their government in the council, although rare. In general, both institutions try to be as uniform a front as possible as the divide usually is often more Parliament against Council as opposed to country vs country or party vs party. For this reason, letters to MEPs do not really make sense if the goal is to achieve a blocking minority in the Council. Those letters would have to go to governments.",

Furthermore, journalists are usually just as uneducated about EU policymaking and readers on average not very interested, which is why EU topics are usually not very salient, and if they are reporting on them is usually of atrocious quality. The European institutions provide excellent public information in the policy cycle, proposals and opportunities to have your say on their websites. It is just that policy making is complex and if it is not your special interest it is hard to filter and digest.",

            "body": "If dead internet theory and bots are the main concern, why not simply target social media companies with more strict legislation to combat that. The mainstream social media platforms have the tools to easily detect bots without identification or chat control. Do you remember the \"prove you're not a bot\" prompts when opening websites, measures like that could work on social media as well. \n\nThe real reason why social media is full of bots is late stage capitalism. Social media companies are chasing infinite growth in an a relatively finite market. The only way they can really grow/inflate their numbers is with bots. Imagine if we would take out all bot users of social media platforms today, the stock prices of these companies would plummet, because it would become apparent how many real users they actually have, which is far less than the reported figures. In other words, social media companies benefit massively from bots, so why would they solve the issue? Chat control and online ID won't change that.\n\nSecondly, chat control won't protect us from criminals either. Criminals can easily use their own platforms, like they do today, to circumvent this legislation. It's like using a shotgun to kill a fly, but the fly can easily fly in any other direction to evade it. \n\nThe only thing this proposed legislation can achieve is mass surveillance, there are no other \"benefits\". You might think: \"I'm not that interesting, so why do I care?\". The thing is, there are numerous people that are interesting to be surveilled at this level. Think journalists, judges, lawyers, politicians, police, etc. These professions have one thing in common: they are responsible to uphold our democratic norms and values, they ensure that the political powers remain separated and in check. \n\nImagine you're Russia, China, or any criminal organisation capable of hacking secure infrastructure. With this legislation, they have a honeypot to with 1 hack, social engineering or infiltration, get all chat history of people in influential or important positions. They can blackmail and extort these people to get what they want. It is a massive, massive risk to democracy.\n\nSo when you say: \"I'm in favor of a more controlled internet\", you're basically saying: \"I wave all my democratic rights and be a loyal servant to whatever regime holds the keys to the internet.\" Today, this regime can be a regime you trust, but you just created the tools for whichever regime comes after to have total control over the internet.",
